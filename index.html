      <h2>Barely Breathing</h2>
      <pre>
        
                     Em
I know what you're doing,
                 A
I see it all to clear
                  C
I only taste the saline
                       Dsus2
when I kiss away your tears
                    Em
You really had me going,
               A
wishing on a star
                            C
But the black holes that surround you
                Dsus2
are heavier by far
                       Em
I believed in your confusion,
                        A
you were so completely torn
                               C
Well it must have been that yesterday
                        Dsus2
was the day that I was born
                      Em
There's not much to examine,
                         A
there's nothing left to hide
                        C
You really can't be serious 
                       Dsus2
if you have to ask me why

            F
 I say good-bye... 
 *CHOURS*             C
'Cause I am barely breathing
                      G
And I can't find the air
                       Am
I don't know who I'm kidding
                F
Imagining you care
                         C
And I could stand here waiting
                    G
A fool for another day
                          Am
But I don't suppose it's worth the price,

worth the price

The price that I would pay 


                 Em
Everyone keeps asking,
                A
what's it all about?
                   C
I used to be so certain
                    Dsus2
and I can't figure out
                 Em
What is this attraction?
                 A
I only feel the pain
                         C
There's nothing left to reason 
                 Dsus2
and only you to blame
              D (5th) 
Will it ever change?
 
*CHOURS*
C                         G
But I'm thinking it over anyway...
      D
I've come to find
       Am
I may never know
      G
Your changing mind
        F
Is it friend or foe? 
   D
I rise above
    Am
Or sink below
      G
With every time
     F
You come and go
 F                    Em
Please don't come and go 

*CHOURS*
                        Em
Well, i know what your doin,
                   A
I see it all too clear

Hey, where did wo go   days when the rain came

          C    G             D7         G
Down in  the hollow    playing a new game

Laughing, and a running, hey, hey

with our hearts a thumpin' and you,  my brown eyed girl

C    D7        G    D7
You, my brown eyed girl

Whatever happened to Tuesday and so slow
Going down to the old mine
With a transistor radio
Standing in the sunlight laughing
Hiding behind a rainbow's wall
Slipping and a sliding
All aling the waterfall
With you, my brown eyed girl
You, my brown eyed girl

bridge:

D7
Do you remember when we used to sing

G         C       G      D7
Sha la la la la la la la te da   Just like that

G         C       G      D7         G
Sha la la la la la la la te da  la te da


Now that I'm all on my own
I saw you just the other day
My, how you have grown
Cast my memory back there Lord
Sometimes I'm overcome thinkin' 'bout it
Laughing and a running hey, hey
Behind the stadium
With you, my brown eyed girl
You, my brown eyed girl

Do you remember when we used to sing

D7   G          C
     Sha la la la la la la la

You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset

She's going off about something that you said 
                                       G
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
D                                       A
I'm in the room it's a typical Tuesday night 
                                                Em
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like 
                                      G
And she'll never know your story like I do

But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts

She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers 
Em                              G
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
                A
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you 
A                                     Em
Been here all along, so why can't you see?

You belong with me, you belong with me


D                                               A
Walkin' the streets with you and your worn out jeans 
                                              Em
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be 
                                        G
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself 
Hey isn't this easy 


    D                                                 A

I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down 
You say you're fine, I know you better then that

Hey whatcha doing with a girl like that 


Em                    G
She wears high heels, I wear sneakers 
D                      A
Shes cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers

Been here all along, so why can't you see?

Standing by and waiting at your back door

D A Em G

                  Em
Oh I remember you drivin' to my house

In the middle of the night 
        D
I'm the one who makes you laugh 
         A
When you know you're about to cry 
      Em
And I know your favorite songs

And you tell me about your dreams
