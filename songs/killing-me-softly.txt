Em~                        Am7~
Strumming my pain with his fingers
D7~                      Gm~
Singing my life with his words
Em~                        Am7~
Killing me softly with his song
             D~            C~
Killing me softly with his song
              Gm~             C~
Telling my whole life with his words
           F~              E
Killing me softly with his song


Am7        D
I heard he sang a good song
Gm         C
I heard he had a style
Am7      D
And so I came to see him
Em
And listen for a while
Am7          D7
And there he was this young boy
Gm         B7
A stranger to my eyes



Em                         Am7
Strumming my pain with his fingers
D7                       Gm
Singing my life with his words
Em                         Am7
Killing me softly with his song
             D             C
Killing me softly with his song
              Gm              C
Telling my whole life with his words
           F               E
Killing me softly with his song


Am7           D
I felt all flushed with fever
Gm           C
Embarrassed by the crowd
Am7         D
I felt he found my letters
    Em
And read each one out loud
Am7            D7
I prayed that he would finish
Gm          B7
But he just kept right on



Em                         Am7
Strumming my pain with his fingers
D7                       Gm
Singing my life with his words
Em                         Am7
Killing me softly with his song
             D             C
Killing me softly with his song
              Gm              C
Telling my whole life with his words
           F               E
Killing me softly with his song



Em                         Am7
Strumming my pain with his fingers
D7                       Gm
Singing my life with his words
Em                         Am7
Killing me softly with his song
             D             C
Killing me softly with his song
              Gm              C
Telling my whole life with his words
           F               E
Killing me softly with his song

Killing me softly with his song
             D             C
