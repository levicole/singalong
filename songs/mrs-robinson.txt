We'd like to know a little bit about you for our files
A
We'd like to help you learn to help yourself

Look around you all you see are sympathetic eyes
E7                          D
Stroll around the grounds until you feel at home


CHORUS

E7
Hide it in a hiding place where no one ever goes
A
Put it in your pantry with your cupcakes
D             G               C           Am
It's a little secret just the Robinsons' afair
E7                        D
Most of all you've got to hide it from the kids

E7
Sitting on a sofa on a Sunday afternoon
A
Going to the candidates debate
D              G              C                  Am
Laugh about it shout about it when you've got to choose
E7                         D
Any way you look at it you lose

D              G          Em
Where have you gone Joe DiMaggio
G                  Em             C    Am         D
A nation turns its lonely eyes to you, woo woo woo
D               G        Em
What's that you say Mrs. Robinson
G               Em            C     Am                   E7
Joltin' Joe has left and gone away, hey hey hey, hey hey hey
