title: You Belong with Me
---
D                                                 A
You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
                                         Em
She's going off about something that you said 
                                       G
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
D                                       A
I'm in the room it's a typical Tuesday night 
                                                Em
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like 
                                      G
And she'll never know your story like I do 


    Em                      G
But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts 
D                       A
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers 
Em                              G
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
                A
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time 


             D
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you 
A                                     Em
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
                G                   D
You belong with me, you belong with me


D                                               A
Walkin' the streets with you and your worn out jeans 
                                              Em
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be 
                                        G
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself 
Hey isn't this easy 


    D                                                 A
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
                                                   Em
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down 
You say you're fine, I know you better then that 
G
Hey whatcha doing with a girl like that 


Em                    G
She wears high heels, I wear sneakers 
D                      A
Shes cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers 
Em                     G
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
                A 
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time 


             D
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you 
A                                     Em
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
                G
You belong with me
D
Standing by and waiting at your back door 
A                                        Em
All this time how could you not know, baby 
                G
You belong with me, you belong with me 

D A Em G

                  Em
Oh I remember you drivin' to my house
       G
In the middle of the night 
        D
I'm the one who makes you laugh 
         A
When you know you're about to cry 
      Em
And I know your favorite songs 
        G
And you tell me about your dreams 
        D
Think I know where you belong 
        A
Think I know it's with me


          D
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you 
A                                     Em
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
                G
You belong with me
D
Standing by and waiting at your back door 
A                                        Em
All this time how could you not know, baby 
                G                   D
You belong with me, you belong with me 
                A
You belong with me 
                              Em
Have you ever thought just maybe
                G                   D
You belong with me, you belong with me
