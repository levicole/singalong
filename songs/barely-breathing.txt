title: Barely Breathing

                     Em
I know what you're doing,
                 A
I see it all to clear
                  C
I only taste the saline
                       Dsus2
when I kiss away your tears
                    Em
You really had me going,
               A
wishing on a star
                            C
But the black holes that surround you
                Dsus2
are heavier by far
                       Em
I believed in your confusion,
                        A
you were so completely torn
                               C
Well it must have been that yesterday
                        Dsus2
was the day that I was born
                      Em
There's not much to examine,
                         A
there's nothing left to hide
                        C
You really can't be serious 
                       Dsus2
if you have to ask me why

            F
 I say good-bye... 
 *CHOURS*             C
'Cause I am barely breathing
                      G
And I can't find the air
                       Am
I don't know who I'm kidding
                F
Imagining you care
                         C
And I could stand here waiting
                    G
A fool for another day
                          Am
But I don't suppose it's worth the price,

worth the price

The price that I would pay 


                 Em
Everyone keeps asking,
                A
what's it all about?
                   C
I used to be so certain
                    Dsus2
and I can't figure out
                 Em
What is this attraction?
                 A
I only feel the pain
                         C
There's nothing left to reason 
                 Dsus2
and only you to blame
              D (5th) 
Will it ever change?
 
*CHOURS*
C                         G
But I'm thinking it over anyway...
      D
I've come to find
       Am
I may never know
      G
Your changing mind
        F
Is it friend or foe? 
   D
I rise above
    Am
Or sink below
      G
With every time
     F
You come and go
 F                    Em
Please don't come and go 

*CHOURS*
                        Em
Well, i know what your doin,
                   A
I see it all too clear
