Hey, where did wo go   days when the rain came

          C    G             D7         G
Down in  the hollow    playing a new game

           C                G
Laughing, and a running, hey, hey

          D7     G       C
Skipping and a jumping in the misty morning fog,

    G       D7           C    D7             G         Em
with our hearts a thumpin' and you,  my brown eyed girl

C    D7        G    D7
You, my brown eyed girl

Whatever happened to Tuesday and so slow
Going down to the old mine
With a transistor radio
Standing in the sunlight laughing
Hiding behind a rainbow's wall
Slipping and a sliding
All aling the waterfall
With you, my brown eyed girl
You, my brown eyed girl

D7
Do you remember when we used to sing

G         C       G      D7
Sha la la la la la la la te da   Just like that

G         C       G      D7         G
Sha la la la la la la la te da  la te da


Now that I'm all on my own
I saw you just the other day
My, how you have grown
Cast my memory back there Lord
Sometimes I'm overcome thinkin' 'bout it
Laughing and a running hey, hey
Behind the stadium
With you, my brown eyed girl
You, my brown eyed girl

Do you remember when we used to sing

D7   G          C
     Sha la la la la la la la
